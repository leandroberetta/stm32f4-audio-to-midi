# stm32f4-audio-to-midi

Audio signal conversion to MIDI notes using an STM32F4 microcontroller (in development).

The initial configuration was generated using [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). 

The project structure was done by the [GNU ARM Eclipse plugin](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io). 

The board used is the STM32F4 Disc1 (using the STM32F407VG).
